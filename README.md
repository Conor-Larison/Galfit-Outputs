This repository shows what sort of outputs to expect from Galfit, and some of the results that I got from my exact fitiing procedure. Fits and Fits2 show the image blocks that are outputs from Galfit. The fitsplotter.py code plots the raw image, the model image, and the residual images from the imageblocks in a panel format in that order, left to right.

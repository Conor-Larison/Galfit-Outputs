This repository shows what sort of outputs to expect from Galfit and some of the results that I got from my exact fitiing procedure. Fits and Fits2 show the image blocks that are outputs from Galfit. The fitsplotter.py code plots the raw image, the model image, and the residual images from the imageblocks in a panel format in that order, left to right.

The most important part of the Output and Output2 directories is the fit.log file. It shows all of the results from the Galfit models, including parameter output values and their errors, as well as the chi-squared value. The order in which the parameters appear can be found in the gfit.py code. These are what are read into the fit results file that can then be used directly as an ASCII table for non-parametric measurements.

Catalog includes all of the models from Fits but with the asymmetry values that I tried to extract shown as well. These were made with catalogmaker.py. Contours contains the same information but with contours shown over top. These were made with contours.py.
